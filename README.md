# Volatility Predictor

A lightweight tool for forecasting stock volatility using ultra-high-frequency data. The project uses financial order book data to compute key metrics, apply time series models, and generate interpretable predictions to help traders make informed decisions.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Predict future volatility for over 100 stocks by processing real trading data.
- **Key Challenges:**
  - Handling ultra-high-frequency data
  - Choosing the right modeling approach (realized volatility vs. direct stock price modeling)
  - Evaluating models using multiple performance measures
- **Outcome:** A prediction tool that not only forecasts volatility but also provides clear insights into underlying market dynamics.

## Requirments

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
