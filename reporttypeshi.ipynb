    "Briefly state the central research question guiding this analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *How accurately can various supervised learning algorithms predict next-day realized volatility in high-frequency equity data?*  \n",

    "\n",
    "The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage involves data quality assessment and feature engineering, which were key to processing the dataset for time-series modelling. High frequency financial data may present challenges such as irregular sampling, missing observations, and noise that must be first addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the consecutive nature of the time series data, it is essential to keep missing data to a minimum and deal with it systematically. Time IDs with at least 70% missing seconds are removed. Bar charts visualise the distribution of missing percentages across time buckets, missing seconds per time ID, and missing seconds across buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Little’s Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) Test was applied to check for patterns in missing data, yielding a p-value of 1.00, indicating MCAR. We imputed low-missing intervals and removed high-missing intervals to preserve data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed non-positive prices/sizes, crossed quotes (ask < bid), out-of-range `seconds_in_bucket`, and duplicate or non-monotonic timestamps within each `time_id`.  \n",
    "2. **Train-Test Split**: Non-random 70–30 split to maintain sequence.  \n",
    "3. **Winsorisation**: Capped extreme values to reduce outlier impact.  \n",
    "4. **Feature Selection**:  \n",
    "   - Pearson correlation ≥ 0.10  \n",
    "   - Mutual information ≥ 75th percentile  \n",
    "\n",

    "Describe each candidate model, its assumptions, and why it’s suited for volatility prediction:\n",

    "- **Random Forest**: Bagged decision trees capturing non-linearities.  \n",
